**guide to setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy for a simple Flask application running on port 8080.**

### Step 1: Installing Nginx

1. **Update your package index:**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```sh
   sudo apt update
   ```
   This command updates the list of available packages and their versions.

2. **Install Nginx:**
   Install Nginx by running:
   ```sh
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```
   This command installs Nginx along with its dependencies.

### Step 2: Setting up a Simple Service at Port 8080

We will create a simple Python Flask application that will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

1. **Install Python and Flask:**
   First, install Python and pip (Python's package installer):
   ```sh
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

   Then, install Flask using pip:
   ```sh
   pip3 install flask
   ```

2. **Create a new Flask application:**
   Create a file named `app.py` and add the following code:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       return 'Hello, World!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
   ```

   This script sets up a basic Flask application that listens for requests on all available IP addresses (`0.0.0.0`) on port 8080.

3. **Run the Flask application:**
   Start your Flask application by running:
   ```sh
   python3 app.py
   ```

   You should see output indicating that the server is running:
   ```sh
    * Running on http://0.0.0.0:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```

### Step 3: Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

Now, we will configure Nginx to forward requests from `http://localhost:80` to our Flask application running on `http://localhost:8080`.

1. **Create a new Nginx configuration file:**
   Open a new configuration file in the `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/reverse-proxy.conf
   ```

2. **Add the reverse proxy configuration:**
   Add the following configuration to the file:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name example.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
       }
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**
   - `listen 80;`: This directive tells Nginx to listen for incoming connections on port 80.
   - `server_name example.com;`: This specifies the domain name that this server block should respond to. Replace `example.com` with your actual domain name.
   - `location / {}`: This block handles requests to the root URL (`/`).
     - `proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;`: This forwards the request to `http://localhost:8080`, where our Flask application is running.
     - `proxy_set_header Host $host;`: This sets the `Host` header in the request to the value of the `$host` variable (the original request's host).
     - `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;`: This sets the `X-Real-IP` header to the IP address of the client making the request.
     - `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`: This appends the client IP address to the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

3. **Save and close the file:**
   Press `Ctrl+O` to save the file, then `Ctrl+X` to exit the editor.

4. **Test the Nginx configuration:**
   Check the configuration for syntax errors by running:
   ```sh
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

   You should see a message indicating that the syntax is OK and the test was successful:
   ```sh
   nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
   nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
   ```

5. **Reload Nginx to apply the new configuration:**
   Reload Nginx to apply your changes:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### Testing the Setup

1. **Access the Flask application via Nginx:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the message "Hello, World!" from your Flask application.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check the Nginx error log:**
   View the last 20 lines of the error log:
   ```sh
   sudo tail -n 20 /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

2. **Ensure the Flask application is running:**
   Confirm that the Flask application is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Verify the firewall settings:**
   Ensure that your firewall allows traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 8080 (for the Flask app). For example, on Ubuntu, you can use UFW:
   ```sh
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp
   ```

4. **Double-check the Nginx configuration file:**
   Ensure there are no syntax errors or typos in the Nginx configuration file.

5. **Restart Nginx:**
   If the issue persists, try restarting Nginx:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

### Conclusion

This guide covers the installation of Nginx, setting up a simple Flask application running on port 8080, configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward requests to the Flask application, and some common troubleshooting steps. By following these steps, you can successfully set up Nginx as a reverse proxy for any backend service running on a different port.
